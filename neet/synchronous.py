Synchronous Network Analysis
============================

The :mod:`neet.synchronous` module provides a host of functions for computing
properties of the dynamics of *synchronously* updated networks. This includes

- :func:`trajectory`
- :func:`transitions`
- :func:`transition_graph`
- :func:`attractors`
- :func:`basins`
- :func:`basin_entropy`
- :func:`timeseries`

The disadvantage of these functions is that they cannot share any
information. If you wish to compute a number of them, then many values will be
repeatedly computed. For this reason, we created the :class:`Landscape` class
to simultaneously compute and several of these properties. This provides much
better performance overall.

        Compute the basin entropy of the landscape [Krawitz2007]_.

        This method computes the Shannon entropy of the distribution of
        basin sizes. The base of the logarithm is chosen to be the
        number of basins so that the result is :math:`0 \\leq h \\leq 1`.
        If there is fewer than :math:`2` basins, then the base is taken
        to be :math:`2` so that the result is never `NaN`. The base can
        be forcibly overridden with the ``base`` keyword argument.
