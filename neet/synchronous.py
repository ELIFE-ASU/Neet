Synchronous Network Analysis
============================

The disadvantage of these functions is that they cannot share any
information. If you wish to compute a number of them, then many values will be
repeatedly computed. For this reason, we created the :class:`Landscape` class
to simultaneously compute and several of these properties. This provides much
better performance overall.

        Compute the trajectory of a state.

        This method computes a trajectory from ``init`` to the last
        before the trajectory begins to repeat. If ``timesteps`` is
        provided, then the trajectory will have a length of ``timesteps
        + 1`` regardless of repeated states. The ``encode`` argument
        forces the states in the trajectory to be either encoded or not.
        When ``encode is None``, whether or not the states of the
        trajectory are encoded is determined by whether or not the
        initial state (``init``) is provided in encoded form.

        Note that when ``timesteps is None``, the length of the
        resulting trajectory should be one greater than the recurrence
        time of the state.
