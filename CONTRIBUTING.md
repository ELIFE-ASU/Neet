## Code of Conduct

This project, and everyone participating in it, is governed by the [Neet Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to [emergence@asu.edu](mailto:emergence@asu.edu).

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Neet. Following these guidelines helps
maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related
reports.

Before creating bug reports, perform a [cursory
search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Aissue+repo%3AELIFE-ASU%2FNeet&type=) to see
if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment
to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If you find a **closed** issue that seems like
it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
issue in the body of your new one.

#### How do I submit a bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you are sure
the bug is either new, or needs to be readdressed, create an issue and provide the following
information by filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include addition details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

  * **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
  * **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For
    example, include a minimal script to reproduce the bug.
  * **Describe the behavior you observed from the script** and point out exactly what the problem is
    with that behavior. For example, include any output you observe and explain what is wrong with it.
  * **Explain what behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

  * **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Neet) or
    was this always a problem?
  * If this problem started recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Neet?**
    What is the most recent version of Neet which does not have this bug?
  * **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem
    happens and under which conditions it typically occurs.
  * If the problem is related to working with external resources (e.g. data files, network
    connections, etc...), **does the problem happen for all resources, or only some?** For example,
    is there a particular data file that seems to cause problems, or are all data file an issue?

Include details about your configuration

  * **Which version of Neet are you using?**
  * **What's the name and version of the Operating System you are using?**

### Suggesting Features

This section guides you through submitting an feature suggestion for Neet, including completely new
features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps
maintainers and the community understand your suggestion, find related suggestions, and prioritize
feature development.

Before creating a feature request, perform a [cursory
search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=+is%3Aissue+repo%3Aelife-asu%2Fneet+label%3A%22feature+request%22+&type=)
to see if it has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of
opening a new one.

#### How do I submit a feature request?

Feature requests are tracked [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you
are sure the request is not a duplicate, create an issue and provide the following information by
filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

  * **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
  * **Provide a description of the feature** in as much detail as possible.
  * **Propose an API for the feature** to demonstrate how that feature fits in with the rest of Neet.
  * **Give and example usage** for the proposed API. Of course, the output is not necessary.
  * **Reference any resources** on which the feature is based. The references should any
    mathematical details necessary for implementing the feature, e.g. defining equations.

### Your First Code Contribution

Your contributions are more than welcome! It's also advisable that you read through the [API
documentation](https://neet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) to make sure that you fully
understand how the various components of Neet interact before you get started.

For external contributions, we use [GitHub forks](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and
[pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) workflow. To
get started with contributing code, you first need to fork Neet to one of your accounts. As you
begin development, have several recommendations that will make your life easier.

 * **Do not work directly on master.** Create a branch for whatever feature or bug you are currently
   working on.
 * **Create a [draft pull
   request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)** after you first push
   to your fork. This will ensure that the rest of the Neet community knows that you are working on
   a given feature or bug.
 * **Fetch changes from [ELIFE-ASU/Neet](https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet)'s master branch often**
   and merge them into your working branch. This will reduce the number and severity of merge
   conflicts that you will have to deal with. [How do I fetch changes from
   ELIFE-ASU/Neet?](#how-do-i-fetch-changes-from-elife-asuneet)

### Pull Requests

The Fork-Pull Request process described here has several goals:

  * Maintain Neet's quality
  * Quickly fix problems with Neet that are important to users
  * Engage the community in working to make Neet as near to perfect as possible
  * Enable a sustainable system for Neet's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

  1. **Use a clear and descriptive title** for your pull request.
  2. Follow all instructions in the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md).
  3. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
  4. After you submit your pull request, verify that all
     [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing.
     <details>
       <summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>
       If a status check is failing, it is your responsibility to fix any problems. Of course the
       maintainers are here to help, so please post a comment on the pull request if you need any
       support from us. If you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a
       comment on the pull request explaining why you believe that to be the case. A maintainer will
       re-run the status checks for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then
       we will open an issue to track that problem with our own status check suite.
     </details>

### Python Style Guide

All Python code must adhere to the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python
Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

To enforce this, we use both [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) and
[flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/). We recommend running these **before** each commit
(consider setting up a [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit)). To run
them manually:

```shell
$ autopep8 --in-place --recursive neet test
$ flake8 neet test
```

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
    - Use [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) whenever
      possible
    - Use [doctest](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html) in lieu of
      simple code blocks
* Use [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for file unrelated to live
  documentation
* Each module, class, function and method should be documented using a Python docstring.
* Be very **liberal** with examples in documentation
* Use [math](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#math)
  whenever applicable.

#### Modules

All modules should have a docstring which roughly adheres to the following template::

```python
"""
.. currentmodule:: neet.boolean.logicnetwork

.. testsetup:: logicnetwork

    from neet.boolean.examples import myeloid

If the module contains more than computational unit (classes, functions, etc...) then
you should describe the relationship between the components and provide a list of them
using autosummary:

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    LogicNetwork
    myfunc

If there are multiple classes, it is ideal to provide an inheritance diagram (if applicable):

.. inheritance-diagram:: neet.boolean.logicnetwork
    :parts: 1
"""
```

#### Classes

All classes should have a docstring which roughly adheres to the following template:

```python
class LogicNetwork(BooleanNetwork):
    """
    A short, one-sentence description. Follow up with as much detail as you reasonably can about the
    inheritance structure and methods provided by the class. This is a good place to include an
    inheritance diagram and list of methods/properties/attributes of the class:

    .. inheritance-diagram:: LogicNetwork
        :parts: 1

    .. autosummary::
        :nosignatures:

        update

    Move on to describe initialization. The ``__init__`` method does not need a docstring since
    you'll be describing what it does here. Include examples of initialization:

    .. rubric:: Examples

    .. doctest:: logicnetwork

        >>> LogicNetwork([((0, 1), {'00', '11'}), ((0,1), {'01','10})])
        <neet.boolean.logicnetwork.LogicNetwork object at 0x...>

    Also, don't be afraid to use inline :math:`E = mc^2` or block math:

    .. math::

        s(f, x) = \\sum_{j = 1}^N f(x) \\oplus f(x \\oplus e_j)

    Finish up with the parameters and error conditions

    :param table: the first argument
    :type table: list, numpy.ndarray
    :raises IndexError: under some condition
    """

    def __init__(self, table):
        pass
"""
```

#### Functions and Methods

With the exception of `__init__` (see (Classes)[#classes]), all functions and methods should have a
docstring which roughly adhere to the following template:

```python
def update(self, state):
    """
    A short, one-sentence description. Follow up with as many details as you can, within reason.

    .. rubric:: Examples

    .. doctest:: logicnetwork

        >>> myeloid.update([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0])
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    :param x: a description of the first argument
    :type x: list, numpy.ndarray
    :return: a description of the return value and type (:class:`numpy.ndarray`)
    :raises ValueError: under some condition

    .. seealso:: :meth:`LogicNetwork.example_method`
    """
    pass
```

#### Using [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html)

All of the API documentation lives within
[docs/source/api](https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet/tree/master/docs/source/api). Each module gets
it's own RST file, with the files layed out on disk similar to the structure in the source
directory. While we are using autodoc to extract the docstrings from the python source, we don't do
that automatically. Instead, we prefer to be able to specify the order of the various methods,
functions, properties, etc... on the page. This means that you'll have to add a directive to the
corresponding documentation source if you add a new entity to Neet. For example, the
[docs/source/api/boolean/network.rst](docs/source/api/boolean/network.rst)
is formatted as

```rst
BooleanNetwork
--------------

.. automodule:: neet.boolean.network
   :synopsis: Generic Boolean Networks

.. autoclass:: neet.boolean.BooleanNetwork

   .. automethod:: subspace

   .. automethod:: distance

   .. automethod:: hamming_neighbors
```

If you add a new attribute or method to
[`neet.boolean.network.BooleanNetwork`](https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet/blob/ff23e738ee5cb42172a4d0e4b78f18f6c04131ba/neet/boolean/network.py#L14),
you will need to add a corresponding `.. autoattribute::` or `.. automethod::` directive to the
above file.

## Additional Notes

### How do I fetch changes from ELIFE-ASU/Neet?

After you have cloned your fork, add the [ELIFE-ASU/Neet](https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/neet) as a
remote:
```shell
$ git add remote elife https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet
```
To fetch changes from ELIFE-ASU/Neet's master branch:
```shell
$ git fetch elife master
```
This will get all of the changes from the main repository's master branch, but it will not merge any
of those changes into your local working branches. To do that, use `merge`:
```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git merge elife/master
...
```
You can then merge the changes into your feature branch (say `csensitivity`)
```shell
$ git checkout csensitivity
$ git merge master
```
and then deal with any merge conflicts as usual.
