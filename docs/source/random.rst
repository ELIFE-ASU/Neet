Network Randomization
=====================

The previous release of Neet `v0.1.0 <https://neet.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0/>`__ included the
``neet.boolean.randomnet`` module which provided mechanisms for randomizing network models (Boolean
networks, more specificially). However, the maintainers are not quite satisified with the quality
and scope of that module. Rather than postpone the v1.0 release any longer, we have decided to
withhold that module for the time begin.

The `current plans <https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet/issues/139>`_ are to release a totally
redesigned module in the future, possibly with v2.0.

If this is a feature that you desperately need, please feel free to email the developers at
emergence@asu.edu or comment on the relevant `issue <https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/Neet/issues/139>`_
on GitHub.
