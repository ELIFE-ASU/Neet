**Neet** is a python package designed to provide an easy-to-use API for creating
and evaluating dynamical network models. In its current state, **Neet** supports
simulating synchronous Boolean network models, though the API is designed to be
model generic. Future work will implement asynchronous update mechanisms and
more general network types.

## Examples

**Neet** provides a hierarchy of network classes with methods designed to make common tasks as
painless as possible. For example, you can read in a collection of boolean logic equations and
immediately probe the dynamics of the network, and compute values such as the
[attractor cycles](https://neet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/landscape.html#neet.LandscapeMixin.attractors)
and
[average sensitivity](https://neet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/boolean/sensitivity.html#neet.boolean.SensitivityMixin.average_sensitivity)
of the network.

```python
>>> from neet.boolean import LogicNetwork
>>> net = LogicNetwork.read_logic('myeloid-logic_expressions.txt')
>>> net.names
['GATA-2', 'GATA-1', 'FOG-1', 'EKLF', 'Fli-1', 'SCL', 'C/EBPa', 'PU.1', 'cJun', 'EgrNab', 'Gfi-1']
>>> net.attractors
array([array([0]), array([62, 38]), array([46]), array([54]),
       array([1216]), array([1116, 1218]), array([896]), array([960])],
      dtype=object)
>>> net.average_sensitivity()
1.0227272727272727
>>> net.network_graph()
<networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraph object at 0x7b2ce5508510>
```

See the [examples](examples) directory for Jupyter notebooks which demonstrate some of the Neet's features.

## Installation

### Dependencies

**Neet** depends on several packages which will be installed by default when **Neet** is installed
via `pip`:

* [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/)
* [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)
* [pyinform](https://pypi.org/project/pyinform/)
* [deprecated](https://pypi.org/project/Deprecated/)

However, network visualization is notoriously problematic, and so we have two optional dependencies
which are only required if you wish to visualize networks using **Neet**'s builtin capabilities:

* [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
* [pygraphviz](https://pypi.org/project/pygraphviz/)

True to form, these dependencies are a pain. Graphviz, unfortunately, cannot be installed via pip
(see: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/ for installation instructions). Once Graphviz has been
installed, you can install `pygraphviz` via `pip`.

### Via Pip

To install **Neet** via `pip`, you can run the following

```bash
$ pip install neet
```

Note that on some systems this will require administrative privileges. If you
don't have admin privileges or would prefer to install **Neet** for your user
only, you do so via the `--user` flag:

```bash
$ pip install --user neet
```

### From Source
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/elife-asu/neet
$ cd neet
$ python setup.py test
$ pip install .
```

## Getting Help
**Neet** is developed to help people interested in using and analyzing network
models to get things done quickly and painlessly. Your feedback is
indispensable. Please create an issue if you find a bug, an error in the
documentation, or have a feature you'd like to request. Your contribution will
make **Neet** a better tool for everyone.

If you are interested in contributing to **Neet**, please contact the
developers. We'll get you up and running!

## System Support

So far the python wrapper has been tested under `python2.7`, `python3.4` and
`python3.5`, and on the following platforms:

* Debian 8
* Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
* Windows 10

> **Note:** We will continue supporting Python 2.7 until January 1, 2020 when
[PEP 373](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#maintenance-releases) states
that official support for Python 2.7 will end.
