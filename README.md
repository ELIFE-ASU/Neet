# Neet: Simulating and analyzing network models

**Neet** is a python package designed to provide an easy-to-use API for creating
and evaluating network models. In its current state, **Neet** supports
simulating synchronous Boolean network models, though the API is designed to be
model generic. Future work will implement asynchronous update mechanisms and
more general network types.

If you are interested in using **Neet**, you'll definitely be interested in
checking out the documentation - https://elife-asu.github.io/Neet.
